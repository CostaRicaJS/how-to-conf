# How-to Conf

This is everything we know about how to put on CascadiaJS or a conference like it. This information is not canonical and YMMV. But these practices have worked for us and we hope that by documenting them more people will take the leap and organize a conference for their community.

## Organizing Team



## Timeline

You want to begin planning for your conference at least 6 months out. Here is a sample timeline:
* T - 6 months: Pull together a core group of conference organizers. 
* T - 5 months: Lock down venue and complete the sponsorship brochure. 
* T - 4 months: Lock down top-tier sponsors.
* T - 3 months: Batch #1 tickets go on sale.
* T - 2 months: Batch #2 and #3 tickets go on sale.
* T - 1 month: Batch #4 (last chance) tickets go on sale.
* CONFERENCE
* T + 1 day: Thank you email to attendees and survey.
* T + 1 week: Personal thank you emails to speakers and sponsors.
* T + 2 weeks: Post-mortem with organizing team, photos, videos, etc.

## Picking a Venue

## Picking a Date

## Format

First, how many attendees do you expect?
* 0-100 people: 1 track, 1 day conference.
* 101-300 people: 1 track, 2 day conference.
* 300-600 people: 2 track, 2 day conference.
* 600+ people: too many people.

## Dealing with Money



## Expenses

## Ticket Sales

We choose to release tickets in 3-4 batches where the price of the ticket increases with each batch. This strategy has several nice benefits:
* Selling "early bird" tickets at a discount rewards your most passionate and enthusiastic community members.
* You give your team a more achievable goal (sell 30 tickets as opposed to 300).
* Affords multiple opportunities to promote your conference over time.
* You can be more agile and react to feedback on pricing (too expensive, too cheap, need a bigger venue, etc).


## Sponsorships

Build a target list of potential sponsors. Use other similar conferences as a guide for companies that might be interested in sponsoring your event. Have at least 50 companies in your target list.

Consider 3-4 tiers of sponsorship. Let's use an example to see how you might calculate these tiers:

Imagine that your conference budget is $100k. Sponsorships should account for roughly 50% of your budget, so that would be $50k in sponsorships. If you had 3 tiers of sponsorship, this would be a reasonable set of prices for each tier:
* Tier 1 - $8k (3 companies)
* Tier 2 - $4k (6 companies)
* Tier 3 - $1k (2 companies)

You might also consider a $0 "community" tier for companies that cannot afford a sponsorship but can contribute in other ways such as labor, services, promotion, etc.
